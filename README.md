# Neural networks (course)

Assignments of the course Neural Networks at Leiden University, 2018

Authors: Michelle Willebrands and Eva van Weenen

A1: Application of simple classifier, Bayesian classifier and single-layer perceptron to handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset

A2: Follow examples of https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples
* Application of multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network to handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset
* Application of an LSTM to generate text from Nietzsche and a children's book
* Application of an LSTM (sequence to sequence model) to translate1 10.000 English sentences to French sentences
* Application fo a recurrent neural network add and multiply integers
* Application of a simple, denoising and variational autoencoder to digits of the MNIST dataset

A3: Galaxy merger recognition with a convolutional neural network

(Please note that these were the first try-outs with neural networks and in hindsight could use a lot of improvements)
